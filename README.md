## üí° Getting Started

For full documentation, visit [Encord Python API Client](https://docs.encord.com/docs/client/).

First, install Encord Python API Client using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing) package manager:

```bash
pip install cord-client-python
```

Then, create an API key for authentication via the [Encord web app](https://app.encord.com). Pass the resource ID and API key as environment variables or pass them explicitly when you initialise the CordClient object.

```bash
export CORD_PROJECT_ID="<project_id>"
export CORD_API_KEY="<project_api_key>"
```

Passing the resource ID and API key as environment variables, you can initialise the Encord client directly.

```python
from cord.client import EncordClient

client = EncordClient.initialise()
```

If you want to avoid setting environment variables, you can initialise the Encord client by passing the resource ID and API key as strings.

```python
from cord.client import EncordClient

client = EncordClient.initialise("<resource_id>", "<resource_api_key>")
```

If you wish to instantiate several client objects and avoid passing parameters each time, you can instantiate a CordConfig object, pass the resource ID and API key as strings, and initialise the client with the config object.

```py
from cord.client import EncordClient
from cord.client import CordConfig

config = CordConfig("<resource_id>", "<resource_api_key>")
client = EncordClient.initialise_with_config(config)
```

Once you have instantiated an Encord client, it is easy to fetch information associated with the given resource ID.

```py
from cord.client import EncordClient

client = EncordClient.initialise()
project = client.get_project()
```
